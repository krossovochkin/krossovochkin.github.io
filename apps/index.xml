      <description>How to play The goal of the game is to win AI opponent by scoring more goals.
The game is turn based.
On your turn you should move the &amp;ldquo;ball&amp;rdquo; (card opened from your deck) to opponents goal.
You start from the row that is close to your goal: you should select a card in a row and if it matches by value or suite - proceed to the next row up until the opponent&amp;rsquo;s goal.</description>
