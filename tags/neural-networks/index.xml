      <description>Disclaimer It is brief synopsis of Neural Networks and Deep learning course on Coursera. That course is a first part of Deep learning specialization. Though course is great and very useful, I found that it has a lot of mathematics explanation (linear algebra — matrices, derivatives etc.), so sometimes it was difficult to wait for the actual useful information I didn’t know. So, I think I might be interested in reviewing neural networks in the future, but won’t be able to review course information as there will be a lot of such noise.</description>
