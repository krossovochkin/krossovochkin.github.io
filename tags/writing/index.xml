      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I like writing articles. This is the best format for me to share ideas, knowledge and also to better understand some topic. when writing something other people can read you have to dive deep enough so that the picture is complete. It helps systemize thoughts.&#xA;Starting writing was challenging as you don&amp;rsquo;t know what feedback you&amp;rsquo;ll receive. It is always a bit tough to be not correct in something. Fear of making a mistake – while not being a bad thing, as we learn from mistakes – is still here. Don&amp;rsquo;t make that fear stop you from doing what you feel is right.&#xA;I started writing on Medium and publishing in various publications there but then switched to my website quite a while ago.&#xA;After some time of running my stuff, I finally would like to share why I did so and what the pros and cons of that are.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
