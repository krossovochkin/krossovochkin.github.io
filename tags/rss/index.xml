      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Learning is an essential part of doing anything. There are many different ways to learn something. Like active learning (studying) and passive learning (gaining experience), moving towards some particular goal and exploring unknown places looking for new ideas. One can learn using various types of perception - audial, visual, haptic, speech, etc.&#xA;Learning is important in all directions: improving your existing skills or getting new.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think one of the most straightforward ways of learning is active learning towards some particular goal. Some online-course might be an example: you start a course to let&amp;rsquo;s say learn new skills and after you&amp;rsquo;ve completed the course you can say that you&amp;rsquo;ve accomplished the goal and learned something.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;One of the most difficult ways of learning is exploring something new because there is no single way of doing that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
