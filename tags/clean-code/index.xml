We read books to gain insights into best practices and learn how to do things correctly. The concepts from the past were usually crucial and provided a great ramp-up to avoid obvious mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over time, we became flooded with information and opinions. In such an environment, old-time thoughts may even seem better, as theyâ€™ve been tested by time and by many engineers in the field.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
