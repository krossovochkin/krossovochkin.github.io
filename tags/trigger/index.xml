      <description>Introduction SQLite is one of the most used database. This is because it is used on almost all mobile devices in the world. As SQLite is very similar to SQL everyone already knows the basic concepts like querying, inserting, updating, deleting data; databases and tables; joining tables etc. But SQLite also has some advanced features and this article is about one of such called Trigger.
If we try to speculate on the name “Trigger” we might say that probably something will be done when some changes are made to the database.</description>
