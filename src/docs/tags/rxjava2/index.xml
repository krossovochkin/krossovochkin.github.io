      <description>Introduction For a long time RxJava was undisputed leader for reactive solutions on Android, though with Kotlin expansion and introducing cold streams (Flow) seems situation might be rapidly changing in the coming years. Though reactive programming is not related to threading in the first place, concurrency and parallelism are very important anyway. In this article we’ll try to make short recap on threading in RxJava 2 (with some basic caveats on its usage) and then take a look at how threading works in Kotlin Flow, so if anyone would like to migrate their code without affecting functionality it would be nice and smooth.</description>
