      <description>Introduction Kotlin extensions are a cool feature. Though trying to write &amp;lsquo;idiomatic&amp;rsquo; Kotlin code some developers tend to overuse that feature making code worse than it could be without extensions. In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll go through some examples of how not to write Kotlin extensions.
First of all, we need to try to define what a good extension is.
It is simple though vague: good extension solves some problems. When we talk about code the main feature extensions have is to improve readability.</description>

      <description>Introduction It might happen so that there is a bug in your release build while in debug everything works fine. In many cases, it might be an issue with Proguard/R8 configuration. Of course, it is better to test your code thoroughly, properly configure Proguard if you, let&amp;rsquo;s say, load some classes only via reflection and so on. But reality sometimes strikes and bugs might go to production.
In this case, the first thing that is needed is to find a bug and fix it.</description>

      <description>Introduction Learning is an essential part of doing anything. There are many different ways to learn something. Like active learning (studying) and passive learning (gaining experience), moving towards some particular goal and exploring unknown places looking for new ideas. One can learn using various types of perception - audial, visual, haptic, speech, etc. Learning is important in all directions: improving your existing skills or getting new.
I think one of the most straightforward ways of learning is active learning towards some particular goal.</description>

      <description>Introduction Android Room is an awesome AndroidX library. It is great because it provides a clean way of how to deal with databases without introducing some heavy concepts. Out of the box with Room one gets:
 simplified code comparing with raw SQLite queries working via DAO interfaces and models instead of Cursors auto-generated &amp;ldquo;boilerplate&amp;rdquo; code for queries migration support Android Studio tooling (compile-time verification of queries and highlight) support for reactive streams (RxJava, Kotlin Flow) and more  In this article, I&amp;rsquo;d like to discover some hidden costs Room applies to support reactive streams and how one can try to avoid them.</description>

      <description>Introduction Boolean is one of the essential types in programming and probably one of the simplest because it has only two values: true and false. Boolean are usually used as flags for control flow, specifically, conditions.
if (string.isEmpty()) { println(&amp;#34;String is empty&amp;#34;) } It is not much interesting in Boolean, but in Kotlin there is one thing which might be confusing if used - it is method not().
Negate Boolean If we look at declaration of Boolean class in Kotlin we&amp;rsquo;ll see five methods, four of which are pretty obvious: and, or, xor and compareTo.</description>

      <description>Introduction Working with numbers in programming never was a simple thing. In math, we deal with various sets of numbers - whole numbers, rational, complex. All these sets are infinite - that means that for any number we can find another smaller one and one which is bigger. In programming when we work with numbers we deal with some subset of these sets - that many that can be represented with a given amount of bits.</description>

      <description>Introduction About two years ago I made a post about a tricky case in Kotlin-Java interop related to the usage of function references and SAM conversion. One of the points there was that in Kotlin, if interface is declared instead of a function, one has to explicitly create an object, therefore no caveats as with interop:
val callback = object : ThirdParty.Callback { override fun onValueChanged(value: Int) { this@App.onValueChanged(value) } } With Kotlin 1.</description>

Introduction Recently the article about Kotlin Flow benefits over RxJava was published by Antoni Castejón García: Kotlin Flow benefits over RxJava
Though Antoni made a good work and many thanks to him for providing his feedback and experience (we need to share our thoughts, this improves community acknowledgment in various areas) — I found few places in the article with which I don’t fully or partially agree. Some points, in my opinion, were missing.</description>

      <description>Introduction I am an Android Developer from the beginning of my professional career. Straight from the University, I’ve jumped into Android development, and to this day continue my journey. During that time I’ve worked in different areas: enterprise, product business applications, SDK development. But all that started with mobile game development.
The first project I took part in was called “nICE”. It was a match-3-like game. It was at the time when there was Android Market and not Google Play Store, when we used Eclipse and not Android Studio and, of course, used Java.</description>

Introduction Many of us first learned Kotlin after Java. Learning process was fairly simple because Kotlin has many similarities when at the same time improves development experience by fighting common pain points Java developer (especially on Java 6, which is common in Android world) has to encounter every day.
There are a bunch of articles about cool Kotlin features like immutability, handling nullability, smart-cast, data classes, and so forth.</description>

Introduction One of the important parts of application development is to make it accessible to as many users as possible. This includes people with impaired vision, color blindness, impaired hearing, impaired dexterity, cognitive disabilities, and many other disabilities. Making an app accessible is challenging but rewarding. The difficulty is because the development team should pay attention to some details which often might be overlooked. Though besides some advanced accessibility support might be too expensive to add, there are still some basic best practices to ensure that your app development is heading in the right direction (and can be improved later over time).</description>

Introduction When we write program in Java we create some classes, methods, fields and put all of this into our source code — .java files. After these files are compiled with javac (Java Compiler) into .class files we got a bunch of Java bytecode. It turns out that not only we create classes, methods and fields in our source code, but also compiler by itself can create them when needed.</description>

Introduction Error handling is fundamental in reactive programming. Reactive streams might fail with exception and propagate it as an event downstream notifying consumers on the error that happened. As in previous articles, we’ll try to compare RxJava and Kotlin Flow error handling mechanisms. This might help us to migrate existing code from RxJava to Kotlin Flow and also understand how to properly use Kotlin Flow.</description>

Introduction Modern Android development is based on Kotlin, which is interoperable with Java. Whenever we use some cool feature from Kotlin (say High-order functions) under the hood (when running on JVM) the feature is implemented in terms of Java bytecode. This might lead to some overheads in memory and performance if used without caution (for example excessive usage of lambdas with parameters without inlining might produce a lot of anonymous classes and put additional pressure on GC).</description>

Introduction For a long time RxJava was undisputed leader for reactive solutions on Android, though with Kotlin expansion and introducing cold streams (Flow) seems situation might be rapidly changing in the coming years. Though reactive programming is not related to threading in the first place, concurrency and parallelism are very important anyway. In this article we’ll try to make short recap on threading in RxJava 2 (with some basic caveats on its usage) and then take a look at how threading works in Kotlin Flow, so if anyone would like to migrate their code without affecting functionality it would be nice and smooth.</description>

      <description>Introduction SQLite is one of the most used database. This is because it is used on almost all mobile devices in the world. As SQLite is very similar to SQL everyone already knows the basic concepts like querying, inserting, updating, deleting data; databases and tables; joining tables etc. But SQLite also has some advanced features and this article is about one of such called Trigger.
If we try to speculate on the name “Trigger” we might say that probably something will be done when some changes are made to the database.</description>

      <description>Introduction RxJava is a very powerful library, though it has some issues as well. Specifically performance and memory issues, which come from problems library tries to solve and how the solution is designed from technical perspective. In order to minimize overhead in RxJava there are a number of optimizations, which are called “operator fusion”. And we’ll talk about them in this article. But first let’s recap how RxJava reactive types work and what issues they have.</description>

      <description>Introduction It happens often that on interviews you’ve asked to perform some coding task. For unknown reason most of the times you’ve asked to write some code not in the IDE, but on piece of paper. I don’t like such tasks on an interview, because in real life one won’t write any kind of code on a paper. If you need to write something not in IDE you face issues like you can’t quickly change something or write new code in between the lines.</description>

      <description>Introduction Using SimpleDateFormat to format dates and times is a common thing (as Java 8 Time API is not that available on Android yet). Usually it looks like:
val formatter = SimpleDateFormat(&amp;#34;dd MMMM yyyy&amp;#34;, Locale.ENGLISH) formatter.format(date) We can use different formats and locales with not only providing correct translations, but also some additional locale-specific formatting rules.
One tricky thing about SimpleDateFormat formats is why we have M and L when they look identical?</description>

      <description>Introduction I find Rubik’s cube an awesome puzzle. It has simple design, but quite difficult to solve (if you don’t know how to do that). At the same time it is possible to learn how to solve cube — there are a lot of algorithms for solving (for example Fridrich method describes quite a lot of them). These optimized algorithms made popular speedcubing — solving cube on time — with world record of less than 4 seconds.</description>

      <guid>https://krossovochkin.com/posts/2019_07_04_android_version_code_tricks/</guid>
      <description>Introduction Version code is a special integer value which works as an internal version number. It is not visible to end users. Android system uses this number to protect against application downgrades — it is not possible to install new application with version code lower than in currently installed application. Developers can use version code for example for doing specific tasks on updating to specific version.
Version code is placed inside AndroidManifest, but usually it is inside *defaultConfig *in build.</description>

      <description>Introduction I don’t know for what reason but I see from time to time same misunderstanding on different throttle operators in RxJava. Usually nobody says about throttle, instead by default everyone says that debounce can be used. Especially using debounce to avoid multiple clicks on buttons is commonly suggested, which I believe is a bad UX (some examples here and here). Let’s finally look at available options in RxJava and find out when it is better to use what.</description>

 Disclaimers:
 I’ll use Windows and more particularly Visual C++ with its Inline Assembler. If you use MacOs or Linux you will have significant differences comparing to what is described in the article. Everything below is shown mostly for demonstration purposes   Introduction Java is mature self-sufficient language, though as we all know it is possible to “connect” java to C (via Java-Native-Interface or JNI) to speed up some critical pieces of code.</description>

      <title>RxJava Observable to Single</title>

      <description>Transforming Single to Observable is simple, as Single satisfies Observable’s contract. Just call single.toObservable() and you’re good. But transforming Observable to Single is not that simple: if it happens that Observable emits exactly one value and completes (or terminates with error without emitting values) then it is pretty straightforward, otherwise one need to set up some additional rules.
In RxJava there are a number of operators for transforming Observable to Single:</description>

In IT, it’s very difficult to keep up-to-date. A full-time job doesn’t give you a chance to upskill or try new things because you’re too busy dealing with legacy code, developing features, etc.
Yet, self-development is an important thing and I’ve tried my best over years to make it a habit.
For the few past years, I’ve conducted a few experiments towards self-improvement, and I’d like to share a few of those here.</description>

      <description>Introduction Before raising a point about some design choices we need to define some criteria.
  Intent/Declaration &amp;gt; Usage/Implementation Code one write should clearly state the intent. Implementation is not that important than an intent.
  Implicit is bad Implicit things do not share the intention, therefore from the first point it means that any implicit thing hides true intent. If anything hides intention — it can be considered bad.</description>

      <description>Introduction After comment that synthetic is no longer recommended practice and some arguments I decided to go deeper into issue with performance of kotlin-android-synthetics by analyzing generated Java and byte code and comparing to other approaches (such as vanilla-*findViewById *and ButterKnife).
Vanilla-findViewById This is sample Activity we’ll work with throughout the article. Approach with *findViewById *will be our baseline.
Sample consists of:
  *Activity *class
  One *TextView *property inside *Activity *with *lateinit *modifier</description>

      <description>I don’t like horror movies. But this short story is not about that particularly. Horror movies are different: murders, ghosts, fantasy etc.
I don’t like horror movies of any kind. But I still can watch them. 1408, final destination, the saw etc.
The only thing that scares me in horror movies are people. Not blood, not ghosts.
Here I’d like to share few movies, which traumatized my psyche in the childhood (and not only).</description>

      <description>Though all the things below are pretty obvious if being careful while dealing with Kotlin-Java interop, I decided still to write short note about one particular issue with function references (from Kotlin side) and SAM conversions (from Java side).
Function reference Function reference is a good way to pass function as a parameter without explicitly using lambdas.
For example, if we have function:
fun method(callback: (Input) -&amp;gt; Output) { .</description>

      <description>Data and interfaces — are two of the most important things in development.
Data usually comes from/to server and tells application what should be used (and therefore shown to the user on UI)
One of the main challenges in mobile development is to be in sync with server. Server is updated immediately (often along with web). Publishing to Play Store takes some time (even not talking about AppStore and their app review).</description>

      <description>Предисловие Наушники — лучший друг разработчика (спасибо открытым пространствам и людям вокруг). Шум и разговоры отвлекают от работы и не дают сосредоточиться. Решением являются отдельные комнаты для небольших команд (что встречается редко и все равно не является стопроцентным, потому что отвлекать может и просто клацание коллегами по клавиатуре) либо наушники плюс музыка в них. Также у музыки на работе есть и другие преимущества. Например, она может выступать в роли якоря.</description>

      <description>В детстве я читал много сказок, и я думаю, что это оказало некоторое влияние на развитие моего мировоззрения. По крайней мере неявно. Конечно, не факт, что в лучшую сторону. У меня было несколько книг, зачитанных до дыр, и собственно ими я хотел сейчас поделиться.
Прежде всего: Да, я читал и знаю большинство популярных русских народных сказок вроде Колобка, различных вариаций сказок про Бабу Ягу и Кощея Бессмертного, всяких Красных Шапочек и Волков с козлятами Братьев Гримм и Гадких утят, Дюймовочек (хотя “Новое платье короля” — это очень сильная сказка) Андерсена и прочих известных сказок.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer It is brief synopsis of Neural Networks and Deep learning course on Coursera. That course is a first part of Deep learning specialization. Though course is great and very useful, I found that it has a lot of mathematics explanation (linear algebra — matrices, derivatives etc.), so sometimes it was difficult to wait for the actual useful information I didn’t know. So, I think I might be interested in reviewing neural networks in the future, but won’t be able to review course information as there will be a lot of such noise.</description>

      <description>Introduction Notifications are widely used in Android applications. Though API is pretty straightforward, there are some key things that one should know and understand. This article will try to be first step into understanding Notifications API.
Sending Single Notification Notification singleNotification = new NotificationCompat.Builder(this) .setContentTitle(&amp;#34;Title&amp;#34;) .setContentText(&amp;#34;Text&amp;#34;) .setSmallIcon(R.drawable.ic_notification) .build(); NotificationManagerCompat notificationManager = NotificationManagerCompat.*from*(context); notificationManager.notify(notificationId, singleNotification); Key things here:
  We use NotificationCompat.Builder to have single interface for creating notifications and let Support Library do all compatibility tricks;</description>
